Right now, it's all hardcoded to load things from odiuser@dc2.. I wonder if I could reuse the same dss service that odi portal uses?

import.js could block for a long time.. 
I should switch to start/status instead of run

## Requirement

Currently, this service requires user to have following key installed on their home directory
~/.ssh/odiuser.id_rsa

## TODO

Report to progress service!
